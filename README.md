# BharatIntern 2023
Here are 2 Machine learning models given as a task by Bharat Intern under a virtual internship program.

Task 1-Wine Quality Prediction

In this task, I constructed a powerful machine learning model using linear regression. This model is designed to forecast the quality of wine by examining a range of different characteristics and attributes. 
Through the utilization of a thorough dataset, I have successfully crafted a model that offers valuable information and predictions about wine quality.

Task 2-Iris Flower Classification

This project is a machine learning project aimed at classifying Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal attributes.
Three different classification algorithms were used:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A binary classification algorithm that estimates the probability of a given input belonging to a particular class.

2. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: A non-parametric and instance-based learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors.

3. **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier that applies Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption of independence between features.
